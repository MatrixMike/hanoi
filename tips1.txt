So after installing  { sudo make install } and executing in a directory with a main.c 
I find makefile.am but it did not contain any targets so when make is executed hardly anything happens.
This looks as if it could be useful for me as I have lots of test main scraps that could be collected and made to be useful.
What do you want users to do after autogenam ?

e.g. I did : autogenam hanoi hanoi.c
